# Blueprints

A blueprint describes how a [plan](user-guide/plans/index.md) is structured. A plan consists of sections in which there is basic information about the plan overall or the specific section. Also, in the blueprints sections, we can specify the [templates](user-guide/templates.md) of the [descriptions](user-guide/descriptions/index.md) that can be added to them. It is not mandatory for a section to have description templates attached but there has to be **at least one** section that has.

The way we create a blueprint is described in detail in the [blueprint administration](admin-guide/content-management/blueprints/index.md) section of the docs.
