# Templates

A template dictates the structure of a [description](user-guide/descriptions/index.md). This means that every description must have a description template attached. It is the most important part of a plan's structure because it contains the sections and the actual question definitions the end users will have to answer, to complete the [plan](user-guide/plans/index.md).

The way we create a template is described in detail in the [template administration](admin-guide/content-management/templates/index.md) section of the docs.
