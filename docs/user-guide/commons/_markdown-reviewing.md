Contributors of a [plan](user-guide/plans/index.md) can have the `Reviewer` role which grants them read access on the plan and its [descriptions](user-guide/descriptions/index.md). Reviewers can also publish comments on the questions of the descriptions using the [annotations](optional-services/annotations.md) feature.
