# Invite collaborators

The plan can be further edited by inviting users in order to collaborate on it and complete it. There are two methods to invite users:

- **External**: If the user is registered in the application, then a notification (email or in App) gets sent to him. If not, a registration email is being sent instead.
- **Internal**: It's a quick way, that we can invite users already associated to other plans we work with as well.

*Invite users*

For each member, a role on the plan must be defined. There are four different roles:

- **Owner**: Manage and edit all plan features.
- **Viewer**: Have only read access.
- **Description Contributor**: Edit only the descriptions of this plan.
- **Reviewer**: View the plan without being able to edit it, but create comments.

:::note
- All the roles can view comments of entire plan
- The collaboration roles we discussed above, can be applied to an entire plan or only to a specific section of it.
