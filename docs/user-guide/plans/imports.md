# Imports

You can import an existing plan so that you don't have to work on a new one from scratch. 
Import supports following file formats:
- **XML**
- **JSON**

*Import plan from xml file*

:::info

The upload of `JSON` file is produced according to [RDA specifications](https://github.com/RDA-DMP-Common/RDA-DMP-Common-Standard) for machine-actionable plans. RDA does not contain the information about the blueprint. Also, for each description the template must be defined and in which section of the plan will belongs. Therefore, a form appears for selecting this data.

When the import is completed, you get redirected to the [`My Plans`](user-guide/plans/my-plans.md) page.
