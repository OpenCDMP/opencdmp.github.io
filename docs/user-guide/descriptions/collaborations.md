# Collaborations

Contributors of a [plan](user-guide/plans/index.md) can have the `Description Contributor` role which grants them read access on the plan and its [descriptions](user-guide/descriptions/index.md). Description Contributors can also add or edit existing descriptions.

:::info

This role can be granted to as many users as needed for collaboration.
