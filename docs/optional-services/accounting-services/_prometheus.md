# Prometheus Integration

The Accounting service exposes its metrics in a format compatible with [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/).  
By accessing the metrics endpoint of the Accounting service, all [available metrics](optional-services/accounting-services/accounting-preview.md#metrics) are displayed in a structured format that Prometheus can scrape and process for monitoring and alerting purposes.

:::info
Prometheus data can be found at the `/api/metrics`
