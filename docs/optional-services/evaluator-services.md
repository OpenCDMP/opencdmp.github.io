# Evaluator Services

The `Evaluator Services` are standalone services responsible to support the evaluation and ranking of [plans](user-guide/plans/index.md) and related [descriptions](user-guide/descriptions/index.md).

These are the evaluator services that are implemented and integrated.

- **Evaluator RDA maDMP**: This evaluator checks whether a plan or description conforms to the [RDA DMP Common Standard](https://github.com/RDA-DMP-Common/RDA-DMP-Common-Standard) JSON schema. It ensures that plans and descriptions generated by OpenCDMP adhere to the standards for machine-actionable DMPs, providing a validation feedback based on the JSON schema defined by the RDA.

- **Evaluator OSTrails**: This evaluator verifies whether a plan or description aligns with the [OSTrails](https://github.com/OSTrails/DMP-Evaluation-Service) metadata and policy framework. It assesses the completeness, openness, and reproducibility of the research data management strategy by checking compliance with OSTrails guidelines. This ensures that OpenCDMP plans support open science principles and follow responsible data stewardship practices.
