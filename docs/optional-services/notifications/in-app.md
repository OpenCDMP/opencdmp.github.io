# InApp

These notifications are internal and can be viewed when the user clicks the `notifications` icon, next to the profile picture at the top menu bar.

There are two options. The user can either view the latest unread notifications directly showing in the dropdown that comes up when he clicks the menu bar icon or view all of them in a table view, by clicking the `Αll notifications` button. He can also mark them all as read by clicking the `Read all` option.
