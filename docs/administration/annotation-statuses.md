# Annotation statuses

In this page, there is a listing where you can view details about all the available annotation statuses. You can view details about the annotation service [here](/docs/supplementary-services/annotations.md).

The information displayed by default is: the `label`, the `internal status` which is the system specific status, the `status` of the entity and timestamps for the `creation` and `updating` of the entities. At the top right corner of the listing you can also select which columns to display.

:::tip

For annotation statuses, all the columns are visible by default.

You can edit or remove a status by clicking on the three dots on the far right corner of the records and then select `Edit` or `Delete` respectively.

## Authorization

Only users that have the global **Admin** role or the tenant specific **TenantAdmin** role can access this page.

## Navigation

This view is available when the user presses the `Annotation Statuses` link from the side navigation menu.

## Pagination

Not all the records are being displayed at once. By default, there is a pagination of 10 records applied to them. 

You can control how many records are being displayed at any time, by adjusting the `items per page` control at the bottom left corner of the table.

## Filtering

There are some filtering options available for annotation statuses.

- **Is Active**: By toggling this control you can view only the active or only the disabled annotation statuses.<br/>*By default, this option is set to true.*
- **Internal Status**: You can filter statuses by the internal status they could relate with. You can select one or more statuses.<br/>*By default, no status is selected.*

In order for the filters to apply, you have to click the `Apply filters` button. 

You can also clear any filters already applied, by pressing the `clear all filters` option, located at the top of the popup.
