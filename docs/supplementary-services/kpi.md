# KPI Service

The `KPI` is a standalone service responsible to support graph charts for any kind and type of data. To create a KPI chart, an **indicator** must be defined. Each data point on the graph is called an **indicator point**. KPI also supports the feature to define **user access** for an existing indicator.

An indicator is created by declaring the schema and various metadata about it (label, description, code etc).

:::note
The use of the KPI service is optional and can be used as an add-on feature for an **OpenCDMP** installation.

## Usages
In **OpenCDMP** the KPI service can be used to to generate graphs for core entities such as [plans](/docs/application/plans/index.md), [descriptions](/docs/application/descriptions/index.md), [references](/docs/application/references.md) and users.
