# Evaluator Services

The `Evaluator Services` are standalone services responsible to support the evaluation and ranking of [plans](/docs/application/plans/index.md) and related [descriptions](/docs/application/descriptions/index.md).

There is currently one evaluator service implemented and integrated.

- **Evaluator RDA maDMP**: This evaluator checks whether a plan or description conforms to the [RDA DMP Common Standard](https://github.com/RDA-DMP-Common/RDA-DMP-Common-Standard) JSON schema. It ensures that plans and descriptions generated by OpenCDMP adhere to the standards for machine-actionable DMPs, providing a validation feedback based on the JSON schema defined by the RDA.

:::note
You can create your own evaluator. More details [here](/docs/for-devs/plugins/evaluator.md).
