# Plugins

In this subsection, some `plugins`, that are directly integrated into **OpenCDMP**, platform will be discussed. These plugins are already used in services mentioned in the [supplementary services section](/docs/supplementary-services/index.md), but here you will see how you can create your own **custom** services and add them to the platform.
