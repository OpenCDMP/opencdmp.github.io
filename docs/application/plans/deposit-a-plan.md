# Deposit a Plan

You can deposit a plan to external sources. Every time a plan gets deposited to selected source, it gets assigned a **DOI** (**D**ata **O**bject **I**dentifier) from the [deposit service](/docs/supplementary-services/deposit-services.md). After the successful deposit, the DOI is available in the Plan Overview page, alongside the service in which it got deposited.

:::info
- Deposit feature is available only in [`Plan Overview`](/docs/application/plans/plan-overview.md)
- You can use the deposit feature if current plan status has this action. More details can be found [here](/docs/administration/plan-statuses.md)
