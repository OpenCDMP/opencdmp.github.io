description: What do we call 'references'

# References

There are a lot of cases where the users have to input their anwser selecting from a list of values which may or may not come from an independent external source. In any case, these options are highly configurable and we call them `references`.

A very good example of a reference is the license of a plan. The license options can either be configured as an internal (*static*) or an external (*API*) source.

:::info

The way we configure a new reference is described in detail in the [reference types administration](/docs/administration/reference-types.md) section of the docs.
