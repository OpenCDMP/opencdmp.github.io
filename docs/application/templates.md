# Templates

A template dictates the structure of a [description](/docs/application/descriptions/index.md). This means that every description must have a description template attached. It is the most important part of a plan's structure because it contains the sections and the actuall question definitions the end users will have to answer, to complete the [plan](/docs/application/plans/index.md).

:::info

The way we create a template is described in detail in the [template administration](/docs/administration/templates/index.md) section of the docs.
